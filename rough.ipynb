Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. This helps achieve a nice sear.\\nTwo. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.\\nThree. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.\\nFour. Carefully place the seasoned chicken breasts in the hot skillet. Cook for about five to seven minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach one hundred and sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit (seventy-four degrees Celsius).\\nFive. During the last minute of cooking, add the butter to the skillet. Once melted, spoon the melted butter over the chicken breasts to add extra flavor and moisture.\\nSix. Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for five minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the chicken moist.\")"
